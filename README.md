# Gender identification based on first name

In Polish, most female names end with the letter "a", which allows you to quickly identify the gender from the first name. The exception is the name Bonaventure, which is a male name.
Write the function isMaleName, which, based on the given name (string parameter), will return true if the given name is masculine, or false if the given name is feminine. Remember about the exception which is the name Bonaventure. The function should return true for this name.
